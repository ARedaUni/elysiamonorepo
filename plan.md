# Elysia KI-RAG Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the enhancement of Elysia with Knowledge-Intensive RAG (KI-RAG) concepts based on insights from IQIDIS Legal AI's approach. The goal is to transform Elysia into a more accurate, transparent, and efficient platform for humanitarian documentation.

## Key Synergies

### Architecture Alignment
- **Existing**: Weaviate vector database, decision tree system, tool-based architecture
- **Enhancement**: Leverage IQIDIS's hybrid indexing, Mixture of Experts, and transparency features

### Why KI-RAG for Gaza Documentation
Gaza documentation shares critical KI-RAG characteristics:
- **Dense, specialized knowledge** (humanitarian reports, testimonies)
- **High cost of errors** (misinformation is harmful)
- **Nuanced content** (context matters significantly)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Indexing & Search Enhancement

#### 1. Implement Hybrid Search in Query Tool
- Add BM25 keyword search alongside existing semantic search
- Configure Weaviate's hybrid search alpha parameter
- Implement query expansion with synonyms
- **Files to modify**: `elysia/tools/query_tool.py`

#### 2. Optimize Embeddings
- Research and test AnglE-optimized embeddings for better semantic nuance
- Implement sentence-level embeddings for testimonies
- Add control tokens for query refinement
- **Expected improvement**: 5.52% over current SBERT approach

### Phase 2: Transparency & Observability

#### 3. Add Citation Tracking
- Modify Query Tool to return source chunks with scores
- Add confidence scoring to results
- Implement visual citation graphs
- **Files to modify**: `elysia/tools/query_tool.py`, frontend visualization components

#### 4. Create Feedback Loop
- Add user feedback collection on search results
- Implement feedback-driven reranking
- Store feedback for continuous improvement
- **New endpoints**: `/feedback`, user rating system

### Phase 3: Mixture of Experts Architecture

#### 5. Split Decision Tree into Specialized Agents
- **Sourcing Agent**: Find and verify sources
- **Fact Agent**: Answer specific factual questions  
- **Synthesis Agent**: Generate comprehensive responses
- **Files to modify**: `elysia/tree/tree.py`, create new agent modules

#### 6. Add Reranking Layer
- Implement cross-encoder for result reranking
- Add context-aware filtering
- Optimize for domain-specific relevance
- **Expected improvement**: 13% Top-1 accuracy with control tokens

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

#### 7. Implement FINGER-style Distance Approximations
- Add geometric approximations for far candidates
- Optimize vector search performance (20-60% improvement expected)
- Reduce computation for non-influential operations
- **Files to modify**: Custom Weaviate query optimization

#### 8. Add Preprocessing Pipeline
- Implement document chunking strategies
- Add metadata extraction
- Create document enrichment tools
- **New modules**: Document preprocessing, metadata extraction

## Technical Specifications

### Hybrid Search Configuration
```python
# Weaviate hybrid search with optimized alpha
hybrid_search = {
    "alpha": 0.7,  # Balance between keyword and semantic
    "query": user_query,
    "properties": ["content", "title", "summary"]
}
```

### Embedding Strategy
- **Primary**: AnglE-optimized embeddings for complex humanitarian text
- **Secondary**: Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity
- **Enhancement**: Control tokens for query refinement

### Transparency Features
- Source chunk visualization with confidence scores
- Entity relationship graphs (automated generation)
- Citation tracking with verification status
- User-editable relationship descriptions

### Mixture of Experts Routing
```python
# Decision routing based on query type
if query_type == "factual":
    route_to_fact_agent()
elif query_type == "sourcing":
    route_to_sourcing_agent()
else:
    route_to_synthesis_agent()
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements
- **Search Speed**: 20-60% faster with FINGER approximations
- **Accuracy**: 5.52% improvement with AnglE embeddings
- **Relevance**: 13% Top-1 accuracy improvement with control tokens

### Quality Enhancements
- Reduced hallucinations through index-based search
- Improved source verification and citation tracking
- Better handling of nuanced humanitarian content

### User Experience
- Transparent search process with visible reasoning
- Interactive feedback system for continuous improvement
- Visual entity relationships for better understanding

## Success Metrics

1. **Search Accuracy**: Improved relevance scores on humanitarian queries
2. **Response Quality**: Reduced hallucinations and improved source attribution
3. **User Satisfaction**: Higher feedback scores on search results
4. **Performance**: Faster query response times
5. **Transparency**: Users can track and verify AI reasoning process

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (Search enhancement)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (Transparency features)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks (Mixture of Experts)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (Performance optimization)

**Total**: 9-13 weeks for complete implementation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API while adding enhancements
- **Incremental Rollout**: Phase-by-phase implementation with testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track improvements at each phase
- **User Feedback**: Continuous collection and integration of user input

This plan transforms Elysia from a general RAG system into a specialized KI-RAG platform optimized for accurate, transparent, and efficient humanitarian documentation and analysis.
